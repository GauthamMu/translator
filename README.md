# Translator

Note: This project is not actively maintained.

This is an incomplete rule-based Translator. It currently supports experimental English and German rules. French was considered but never implemented.

## TO-DO (If I wanted to complete this)

- Word order
- Actual context stuff
- Support for punctuation/multiple sentences
- TUI instead of CLI
- etc.

## Why?

This started as a curiosity-driven project to explore how difficult it would be to build a simple rule-based translator from scratch.

During development, I realized how quickly complexity increases when handling:

- Sentence segmentation
- Word order
- Context and grammar rules
- Edge cases in natural language

This project became more of a learning exercise in language processing and system design rather than a production-ready tool.

## AI Usage

Minor parts (e.g., JSON handling, documentation and this README) were assisted by AI tools.
Core translation logic and overall architecture were implemented manually.
