# Translator

This is a rule-based Translator. I'm implementing English and German, and might implement French in the future.

## TO-DO

- Word order
- Actual context stuff
- Support for punctuation/multiple sentences
- TUI instead of CLI
- etc.

## Why?

It's a passion project.

## Did you use AI?

Yes, but the core functionality is human-made. Only minor parts, such as pulling the JSON files in, or the code comments, were partially made by ChatGPT.
